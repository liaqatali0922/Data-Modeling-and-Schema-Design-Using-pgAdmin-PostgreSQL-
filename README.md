# Data-Modeling-and-Schema-Design-Using-pgAdmin-PostgreSQL-
In this Project I used a DVD rental database as sample that has 15 tables. The original database has very complex schema 
and very difficult to understand. I converted this complex schema into a simple star schema that has a single fact table and four 
dimension tables using primary and foreign key relationship.
I created the new model using pgAdmin SQL Query in PostgreSQL and also designed in Draw.io modeling tool.
